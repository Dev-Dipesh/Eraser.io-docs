[PASTE ORIGINAL DIAGRAM OR DESCRIPTION HERE]

Please apply these enhancements:

1. Define entities clearly:
   - Use appropriate entity shapes
   - Include all relevant attributes for each entity
   - Distinguish primary keys (PK), foreign keys (FK), and regular attributes
   - Mark required vs optional attributes

2. Structure relationships properly:
   - Use correct relationship notation (Chen or crow's foot based on preference)
   - Clearly indicate cardinality (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)
   - Label relationships with descriptive verbs
   - Show relationship attributes where applicable

3. Apply visual organization:
   - Group related entities together
   - Position entities to minimize crossing relationships
   - Use consistent spacing and alignment
   - Structure the diagram to flow logically (left-to-right or top-to-bottom)

4. Enhance visual differentiation:
   - Apply color coding for different entity domains/categories
   - Use different border styles for different entity types (strong, weak)
   - Apply visual emphasis to key entities in the system
   - Use consistent styling for similar entity types

5. Include data details:
   - Note data types for attributes where relevant
   - Include constraints (unique, not null, check) where appropriate
   - Add notes for complex business rules or constraints
   - Show derived attributes with appropriate notation

6. Apply appropriate styling:
   - Set notation type (chen or crows-feet)
   - Use colorMode, styleMode, and typeface options for better readability
   - Consider direction setting for optimal layout
