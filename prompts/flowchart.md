[PASTE MERMAID DIAGRAM HERE]

Please apply these enhancements:

1. Use appropriate shapes for component types:
   - Databases/Storage: cylinder shape
   - Services/Microservices: rectangle shape
   - External systems: hexagon shape
   - Security components: diamond shape
   - User-facing applications: oval shape

2. Apply meaningful icons to components:
   - Databases: database icon
   - Cloud services: cloud icon
   - Security: lock icon
   - Applications: monitor/desktop icon
   - Servers/services: server icon
   - Add other relevant icons from the Eraser.io supported icons list

3. Use proper labeling:
   - Apply descriptive labels to all components using the label property
   - Include key attributes in labels (e.g., timeouts, capacity, etc.)
   - Ensure labels are concise yet informative

4. Apply color coding:
   - Group similar components with consistent colors
   - Use different colors for different functional areas
   - Apply matching colors to connection lines to show data flow paths
   - Use hex color codes for specific shades (#XXXXXX)

5. Optimize the diagram flow:
   - Set the appropriate direction (right/down) based on the logical flow
   - Use proper styling (colorMode: pastel, styleMode: shadow, typeface: clean)

6. Enhance connections:
   - Use solid lines (>) for primary flows
   - Use dotted lines (-->) for secondary/fallback flows
   - Add descriptive labels to important connections
   - Color code connections based on their source component

Follow Eraser.io syntax exactly according to the documentation. Make the diagram as visually intuitive as possible while maintaining technical accuracy.

Eraser.io documentation can be found at: /Users/dipeshbhardwaj/Projects/Eraser.io
It contains 8 markdown files with syntax explanation and a JSON file with list of supported icons by Eraser.io. You can ignore the .gitignore file in the directory.
