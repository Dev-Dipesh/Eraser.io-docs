Convert the following architecture diagram to an Eraser.io compatible cloud architecture diagram:

[PASTE ORIGINAL DIAGRAM OR DESCRIPTION HERE]

Please apply these enhancements:

1. Use appropriate node types for cloud components:
   - Use proper service types (compute, storage, network, etc.)
   - Group related services using the group syntax
   - Apply appropriate nesting to show hierarchy

2. Apply meaningful icons to components:
   - Use cloud-specific icons (AWS, Azure, GCP) where applicable
   - Use the correct vendor-specific icon names from the Eraser.io icons list
   - Maintain consistent icon usage across similar components

3. Use proper labeling:
   - Apply descriptive labels to all components using the label property
   - Include key attributes in labels (region, tier, capacity, etc.)
   - Use concise, standardized naming conventions

4. Apply color coding:
   - Color-code by service type or vendor
   - Use different colors for different zones/regions
   - Apply matching colors to related components
   - Use hex color codes for specific shades (#XXXXXX)

5. Optimize the diagram flow:
   - Set the appropriate direction (right is default, use direction statement if needed)
   - Use proper styling (colorMode, styleMode, typeface)
   - Create logical groupings by functionality or deployment zones

6. Enhance connections:
   - Use solid lines for primary connections
   - Use dotted lines for optional/fallback connections
   - Add descriptive labels to important connections
   - Indicate traffic direction appropriately

Follow Eraser.io cloud architecture syntax exactly according to the documentation. Make the diagram as visually intuitive as possible while maintaining technical accuracy.
