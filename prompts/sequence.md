Please apply these enhancements:

1. Define clear participants:
   - Use appropriate participant types (actor, boundary, entity, etc.)
   - Order participants logically from left to right based on flow
   - Group related participants if needed

2. Apply meaningful icons and styling:
   - Use relevant icons for different participant types
   - Apply consistent styling for similar participant categories
   - Use different colors for different system boundaries

3. Structure messages effectively:
   - Use clear, concise message labels
   - Distinguish between synchronous and asynchronous messages
   - Include return messages where appropriate
   - Use self-messages for internal processing
   - Apply proper activation bars to show processing time

4. Enhance readability:
   - Use notes to explain complex interactions or conditions
   - Include dividers to separate logical sequences
   - Use appropriate message styling (solid, dashed) to indicate message types
   - Color-code messages by subsystem or criticality

5. Show parallel processing:
   - Use par, and, or alt blocks where appropriate
   - Clearly label conditions for alternative flows
   - Include timing information where relevant

6. Apply appropriate styling:
   - Use colorMode, styleMode, and typeface options for better readability
   - Apply consistent spacing and alignment
   - Consider using groups to show nested interactions

Follow Eraser.io sequence diagram syntax exactly according to the documentation. Make the diagram as visually intuitive as possible while accurately representing the temporal flow of interactions.
